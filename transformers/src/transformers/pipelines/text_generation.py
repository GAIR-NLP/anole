    Language generation pipeline using any `ModelWithLMHead`. This pipeline predicts the words that will follow a
    specified text prompt. When the underlying model is a conversational model, it can also accept one or more chats,
    in which case the pipeline will operate in chat mode and will continue the chat(s) by adding its response(s).
    Each chat takes the form of a list of dicts, where each dict contains "role" and "content" keys.

    Examples:

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import pipeline

    >>> generator = pipeline(model="openai-community/gpt2")
    >>> generator("I can't believe you did such a ", do_sample=False)
    [{'generated_text': "I can't believe you did such a icky thing to me. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I"}]

    >>> # These parameters will return suggestions, and only the newly created text making it easier for prompting suggestions.
    >>> outputs = generator("My tart needs some", num_return_sequences=4, return_full_text=False)
    ```

    ```python
    >>> from transformers import pipeline

    >>> generator = pipeline(model="HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta")
    >>> # Zephyr-beta is a conversational model, so let's pass it a chat instead of a single string
    >>> generator([{"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France? Answer in one word."}], do_sample=False, max_new_tokens=2)
    [{'generated_text': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'What is the capital of France? Answer in one word.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Paris'}]}]
    ```

    Learn more about the basics of using a pipeline in the [pipeline tutorial](../pipeline_tutorial). You can pass text
    generation parameters to this pipeline to control stopping criteria, decoding strategy, and more. Learn more about
    text generation parameters in [Text generation strategies](../generation_strategies) and [Text
    generation](text_generation).

    This language generation pipeline can currently be loaded from [`pipeline`] using the following task identifier:
    `"text-generation"`.

    The models that this pipeline can use are models that have been trained with an autoregressive language modeling
    objective. See the list of available [text completion models](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=text-generation)
